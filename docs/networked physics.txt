Roughly based on https://gafferongames.com/post/networked_physics_in_virtual_reality/



Changes to network protocol:
* Adding uint32 transform_update_avatar_uid to end of ObjectTransformUpdate, for server -> client direction

* Added ObjectPhysicsTransformUpdate message type

* Added ObjectPhysicsOwnershipTaken and ObjectPhysicsOwnershipReleased message types.



Dejittering buffer
==================
We use a dijittering buffer, which holds onto physics snapshots in a small ring buffer, and inserts them into the physics system at the appropriate time.




Snapshots sent from client A:
-----------------------------
          
    |<------ 0.1 s ------>|
    |---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
   s_0                   s_1                   s_2                  s_3             snapshot name
   t_0                   t_1                   t_2                  t_3             snapshot local time

Bounced via server: (adds jitter)


Received on client B:
                          |----------------------|----------------|---------------------------------|
                         s_0                    s_1              s_2                               s_3
                       recv_t_0

   |<-------------------->|
   transmission_time_estimate
 
recv_t_0: local time on client B when snapshot s_0 is received.

transmission_time_offset: we compute the global time at client B at which the physics ownership packet was received, minus the global time at client A, at which the physics ownership packet was sent.

Played back into internal physics system with some delay (padding_delay), so we can hide the jitter:
                             
                           padding_delay
                          |<------------>|
                                         |---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
                                        s_0                   s_1                  s_2                    s_3
                                    playback_t_0             playback_t_1
    |<---------------------------------->


For any i >= 0:
playback_t_i = t_i + transmission_time_offset + padding_delay


=============================================

Objects become 'physics owned' by a user when the user takes responsibility for computing the physics state of them with their physics engine.

The user X will send a ObjectPhysicsOwnershipTaken message to declare themselves physics owner of the object.

An object is owned by user X if physics_owner_id == user_x_avatar_id && (global_time - last_update_time < 10)


A user will also send ObjectPhysicsOwnershipTaken with the renew flag bit set to 1, to renew their ownership, after half the ownership period (10 s/2 = 5 s) has elapsed.


There are various situations where a user will claim ownership of an object:

Adding object to active_set of physics engine:
Mark as owned by user, if not currently owned by another user.

Direct manipulation of object, e.g.
* Editing object with editor
* Dragging object with move/rotate controls
* Walking into object with avatar

Object that we physics-own leaves active set:
OLD: Send physics_owner_id to invalid id (mark as not owned by anyone),
OLD: Send ObjectPhysicsOwnershipReleased message to server.




A walk-through of physics synchronisation in action
---------------------------------------------------

Client A
--------
User pushes / walks in to object ob.
We process player_physics.contacted_events, which contains ob


Client A takes physics ownership of object ob by setting (see takePhysicsOwnershipOfObject())
    ob->physics_owner_id := client_A_avatar_uid 
    ob->last_physics_ownership_change_global_time := global_time

Client sends ObjectPhysicsOwnershipTaken message to server.

In main timerEvent loop:
    Iterating over physics_world->activated_obs:
        Get updated position, linear vel and angular vel, store in ob.
        Set from_local_physics_transform_dirty = true, store in dirty_from_local_objects

Later in mesage-sending timerEvent loop:
    if from_local_physics_transform_dirty flag is set:
        Send ObjectPhysicsTransformUpdate packet to server



Client B
--------
Receives ObjectPhysicsOwnershipTaken, (see ClientThread.cpp), sets
    ob->physics_owner_id := client_A_avatar_uid 
    ob->last_physics_ownership_change_global_time := global_time

Computes and sets
    ob->transmission_time_offset

Receives ObjectPhysicsTransformUpdate in ClientThread.cpp

Looks up object by UID

    Appends physics snapshot in message to physics_snapshots
    Sets ob from_remote_physics_transform_dirty flag, adds to dirty_from_remote_objects.

In MainWindow timer loop:

since from_remote_physics_transform_dirty is set for ob:
    Adds to active_objects

    Sets ob last_update_was_physics_update := true

Iterating over active_objects:

    Since last_update_was_physics_update is true:

        Since we are not the current physics owner of ob:

            If we have a physics snapshot to insert (global_time >= snapshot.client_time + ob->transmission_time_offset + padding_delay):
                Insert physics snapshot into physics engine with setNewObToWorldTransform().

Client A                           Server                        Client B

          \   /                                     \
          /                                               \
       /  ObjectPhysicsOwnershipTaken client B, t_b         \      ObjectPhysicsOwnershipTaken client B, t_b
    /  ObjectPhysicsOwnershipTaken client A, t_a               \     ObjectPhysicsOwnershipTaken client A, t_a 
  /                \                      
                        \
t_b < t_a, so object becomes owned by client B, 
ObjectPhysicsOwnershipTaken client A message is discarded.
                            \
                               \

                    /                   \
                /                           \
            / ob snapshot from A                 \
        /                                            \
    /                                                      \
/                                                                \
ob snapshot from A is discarded
as A is not owner




ObjectPhysicsOwnershipReleased
==============================

NOTE: Disabled due to issue where the physics engine on the receiving end would release ownership of the object, then the object would be activated,
then the receiving end would claim ownership of the object.
