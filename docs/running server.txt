
Notes for running the substrata server for development
======================================================
server_state_dir is:
On Windows: APPDATA/Substrata/server_data 
On Mac: /Users/USERNAME/cyberspace_server_state
On Linux: /home/USERNAME/cyberspace_server_state

Where USERNAME is the current user name

Resources are saved in server_state_dir + "/resources"

The server state database file is located at server_state_dir + "/server_state.bin"


Webserver public files dir
--------------------------
This directory holds files used by the website, such as CSS files, images, javascript files (map.js) etc.

On Windows, in dev mode:		server_state_dir + "/webserver_public_files"
On Mac:							server_state_dir + "/webserver_public_files"
On Linux:						/var/www/cyberspace/public_html

NOTE: New files in this directory will not be served by the server until it is restarted.


Webclient files dir
-------------------
This directory holds files used for the webclient, such as webclient.js, client.html etc.

On Windows, in dev mode:		server_state_dir + "/webclient"
On Mac:							server_state_dir + "/webclient"
On Linux:						/var/www/cyberspace/webclient


Updating public and webclient files while the server is running
---------------------------------------------------------------
On Windows and Linux, whenever a file is changed in the public files dir or the webclient files dir, all public and webclient files will be reloaded from disk.
This is done via file-system watching.  
This is not implemented on Mac yet.

When running in dev mode (--enable_dev_mode), files in the webclient files dir will be reloaded from disk freshly on each request.


Screenshot dir
--------------
This directory holds upload screenshots from the screenshot bot.

On Windows, Mac:				server_state_dir + "/screenshot_dir"
On Linux:						/var/www/cyberspace/screenshots

Server TLS keypair
------------------
On Windows and Mac, the certificate is read from 
	
	server_state_dir + "/MyCertificate.crt"

and the private key is read from 
	
	server_state_dir + "/MyKey.key"

You can generate such a keypair using OpenSSL / LibreSSL like so:

	openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes -out MyCertificate.crt -keyout MyKey.key



Server Credentials
------------------
Server credentials are stored at
	
On Windows, Mac:				server_state_dir + "/substrata_server_credentials.txt"
Linux:							"/home/" + username + "/substrata_server_credentials.txt"			[Will change]

This contains stuff like

	email_sending_smtp_servername

for sending password reset emails etc.

The Substrata server can run without the server credentials file present, however some features will not work, such as password reset emails.
