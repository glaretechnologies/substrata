Cleaning up challenges

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/substrata.info/fullchain.pem
   Your key file has been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/substrata.info/privkey.pem
   Your cert will expire on 2021-05-19. To obtain a new or tweaked
   version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot
   again. To non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run
   "certbot renew"
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
   making regular backups of this folder is ideal.



To add to Cron
=============================
sudo crontab -e

Add:
0 5 * * * letsencrypt renew

 --quiet doesn't work,  not an option

Should run every day at 5am.
NOTE: not tested
